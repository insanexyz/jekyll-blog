Why don't you just read my posts instead. You probably won't be understanding anything here because I write them in the most broken english possible, just enough to remind me of which topics I need to post.

## Upcoming posts


1. Setup ollama + webui to use llms locally (Just one of the ways to run llms locally with ease and good amount of features). (Delayed for good enough I guess)

2. Calculations in Cpp happens in higher datatypes (double > float > long long int, long int, int, characters). Examples (Upcoming 1)

3. Need for int Class :: static_variable = some value outside the class. Basically to define it and give memory location. Same doesnâ€™t need to be done with normal class variables as they are defined when objects are created. (Upcoming 2)

4. Difference between vmin and vmax in css. vmin is just whatever is min between height and width of a device, and same applied for vmax but instead of min it goes for max. (Upcoming 3)

5. Why use min/max-height/width instead of just width and height? Basically just a responsive unit nothing more. Simply width and height is fixed while other is not if used correctly.

6. What are user-agents styles in css. Styles applied by browsers basically :).
What is element.style in inspect tools? Basically a way to add inline styles to an element.

7. Explain what is docker using a python program which uses 2-3 libraries as dependencies. Then making a container which contains the dependencies to run the python program.

## Random notes ??

1. Cpp for cp. A good playlist but in Hindi. https://youtu.be/9S-b52CSCbQ?si=4z6BRY4EzP0SJNGG

2. Odin project is good for learning web dev, though I first recommend just going and doing various tutorials from yt first in your first months and later brush up through odin project if you need. Web dev at starting is highly visual so if you just see what people are doing you will understand most of the things. Later like any other subject it too will become complex.
