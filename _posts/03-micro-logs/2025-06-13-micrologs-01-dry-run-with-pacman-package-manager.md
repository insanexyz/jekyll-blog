Dry run with pacman package manager

**`Source:`** [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman)  
**`pacman:`** Package manager for Arch Linux

**`-p`** flag can be used with pacman to **dry run** commands â€” that is, see what your command is going to do **before** it actually does anything.

Might not work with certain flag combinations like **``-n``**, and it will simply throw an error.

Flags used in the command -
- **`R`**: **`--remove`** - removes the specified package.
- **`s`**: **`--recursive`** - removes the package and its dependencies that are no longer required by any other installed package.
- **`n`**: **`--nosave`** - removes the package's configuration files as well.

**Optional explanation with simple examples** -

**``pacman -Rns`` :** To remove a package and its dependencies which are not required by any other installed package. 

<br>

 **1.** Normal Behavior -

**2.** **`-p`** flag works well and shows a list of the final packages which will be removed. It only shows what **`Pacman -Rs`** is going to do instead of asking for deletion confirmation to proceed further. -

**3.** **`-p`** doesnâ€™t work when used with **`-n`** flag -
