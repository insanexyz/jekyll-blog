## Normal behavior

Starting code -

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
         .container {
            border: 1px solid black;
            height: 70vh;
            width: 80vw;
            margin: 10vh auto;
        }
        
        .item {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: blueviolet;
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>
        <div class="item">4</div>
        <div class="item">5</div>
    </div> 
</body>
</html>
```

Their is a simple `container <div>` and inside it we have 5 `item <div>s`. By default `<div>` is a block level element so they all get stacked one after another.

Note the `.container` and `.item` styling. This is base styling used in the pictures below as well. It would be removed from later codes to reduce cluttering.

## Display flex

Now we can make this `container <div>` a flexbox (a type of display like block and inline display). <br>
To do this simply make `display: flex` for the `container <div>`.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
}
```

![Flexbox default behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/display-flex.webp)

Here `container <div>` is now called `flex container` and `item <div>s` inside it are `flex items`.

<br>

<br>

## Why the items align the way they did?

When we do `display: flex` we can imagine two axes being created.

![Flexbox default behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/main-cross-axis.webp)

Flex items are always aligned with respect to `main axis`. <br>
Also the `item <divs>` are aligned in order they were written, 1 to 5. <br> 
The axis perpendicular to main axis is `cross axis`.

Their are two **flexbox properties** which can be applied on the `flex container`.
- `justify-content` which always works on the `main axis`.
- `align-items` which always works on the `cross axis`.

Now comes `flex-direction`. This is also a ``flex container`` property. With it we can change directions of main and cross axis. And that's it.

<br>

<br>

## Flex directions

We will use `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` property for the coming examples.

1\. Applying `justify-content: center`.
```css
.container {
    justify-content: center;
}
```

![Justify content made center](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/justify-content-center.webp)

It pushes flex items from left to right in the direction of main axis to make it center in that axis.

<br>

2\. Applying `align-items: center`.

```css
.container {
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

![Justify content and align items made center](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/align-items-center.webp)

It now pushes flex items from top to bottom to make it center in the cross axis.

<br>

### Few examples

1\. Flex direction made **row**.
```css
.container {
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

![Flex direction row behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/flex-direction-row.webp)

This is the default `flex-direction`. The `item <div>s` simply gets aligned on the direction of main axis from 1 to 5.

<br> <br>

2\. Flex direction made **column**.

```css
.container {
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

![Flex direction column behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/flex-direction-column.webp)

This changes the direction of main axis and cross axis. And `flex items` always gets aligned in the `main axis`.

**Note:** Any changes made to `justify-content` would now take effect in the new main axis. And any changes applied to `align-items` would now take effect in the new cross axis.

**Example:** Removing `align-items: center` would reset flex items to `left` instead of `top`.

![Flex direction column and align items flex start behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/flex-direction-column-reset.webp)

<br> <br>

3\. Flex direction made **row-reverse**. 

```css
.container {
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

![Flex direction row reverse behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/flex-direction-row-reverse.webp)

This changes the main axis direction as shown. And so `item <div>s` aligns from right to left this time from 1 to 5.

Or, the first `item <div>` which is `1` will start from tail of the `main axis` followed by others in order.

<br> <br>

4\. Flex direction made **column-reverse**.
```css
.container {
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

![Flex direction column reverse behavior](/assets/images/flex-direction-basics/flex-direction-column-reverse.webp)

The main axis now runs bottom to top and so the `flex-items` gets aligned in the same way.

Their are many other options for flex-direction, justify-content and align-items which follows this same principal.
