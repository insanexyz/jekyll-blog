Simple git commands you would use everyday, nothing else. Best to use as a cheatsheet sort of idk. Enjoy.

<br>

1\. Set username and email. These credentials are used to tell who committed a particular commit.
```bash
# Set it globally.
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

# Set for a particular repository.
cd repo
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

<br>

2\. Get status of which files are untracked, which are in staging area and which are modfiied.
```bash
git status
git status -s # shorter version of "git status".
			  # red M means changes made in file but not staged.
			  # green M means file is staged but not commited.
```

<br>

3\. Add files to staging area.
```bash
git add file1 file2
git add -A (Add all untracked files)
```

<br>

4\. Commit files from staging area.
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

<br>

5\. Match working directory with its last commit version. If the file is staged and you modify it, then running this command will restore it to the staged version instead.
```bash
git checkout path/filename # To match the contents of the file/ files with their last commit verison.
git checkout -f # To match the contents of all modified files to their last commit version.

# git restore is the new version.
```

<br>

6\.  Show history of commits.
```bash
git log

# Show upto n (here 1) commit(s). It will show a detailed overview of the commit(s).
git log -p -1
```

<br>

7\. Compares working directory with the staging area. If the file isn't in staging area then it will compare it with the version last committed version (as that is in the staging area by default).
```bash
git diff
```

<br>

8\. Compare files in staging area with their last commit version.
```bash
git diff --staged
```

<br>

9\. Add/ Stage and commit tracked files in a single command.
```bash
git commit -am "Commit message"
```

Only works for files that are already tracked. Untracked files won't be added. Use `git add -A` or `git add untracked-file-name` for that.

<br>

10\. Remove a file from both **working directory** and from **being tracked**.
```bash
git rm filename

# then commit the changes.
git commit -m "remove filename"
```

<br>

11\. Remove a file **from being tracked** but **not from the working directory**.
```bash
git rm --cached <filename>

# then commit the changes.
git commit -m "remove filename from being tracked"
```

<br>

12\. Example .gitignore. The effects of gitignore file is immediate.
    If the file you want to ignore is already being tracked then writing it down in gitignore won't work. Simply ``git rm --cache`` the file and then it will be ignored by the git.
```bash
*.log       # ignore log files present in any subdir.
/*.log      # ignore log files present in root of the working directory.
somefolder/ # to ignore some folder.
```

<br>

13\. View all branches.
```bash
git branch # By default their will be a master or main branch depening on your git global configs.
```

<br>

14\. Create a branch. When you create a new branch, it starts with the exact state (commits and files) of the branch you created it from.
```bash
git branch branchname
```

If you created it from `main` branch and it had 5 commits. Then this new branch will also have 5 commits and start from their.

<br>

15\. Switch branch.
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

<br>

16\. Create and switch to that branch in one command.
```bash
git checkout -b branchmain
```

<br>

17\. Merge ``branch2`` with ``branch1``.
```bash
git checkout <branch2>
git merge <branch1>
```

Now `branch2` has the changes made in `branch1`.

<br>

18\. Connect GitHub repo (called as remote repo) with your local git repo. Then you can push and pull from this remote repo.
```bash
git remote add origin git-repo-url 

# It will add the repo url under the name origin. So next time whole url can be referred as "origin". Also we can say origin as the remote now.
```

Its basically like `origin = url` in terms of programming.

<br>

19\. See what remote repo have been added.
```bash
git remote -v
```

<br>

20\. Change url a remote (like origin) points to. `Remote name` is simply the name you associated your remote url with like `origin`.
```bash
git remote set-url <remote-name> <new-url>
```

<br>

21\. Remove a remote repo link like `origin`.
```bash
git remote remove origin # Replace origin with whatever you named your remote repo.
```

<br>

22\. Rename a branch.
```bash
# Switch to the branch you want to rename.
git branch <branch-to-rename>

# Rename the branch.
git branch -M <new-branch-name>
```

<br>

23\. Set upstream for a branch.
```bash
git push -u origin main
# Now if you are on main branch, just writing git push would push main branch to origin.
# Won't work if you change branch.
```

<br>

24\. How to push some other branch than `main`.
```bash
git push origin <desired-branch-to-push>
```

<br>

25\. Clone a remote repo.
```bash
git clone <repo-url> # Will clone the repo contents into a folder named after the repo name.
git clone <repo-url> <folder-name> # Will clone the repo contents into <folder-name> folder.
```

<br>

26\. Set default branch as `main` globally.
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

### Notes
1. Tracking a file starts right after you add it to staging area.
2. Committing the file means you tell git to save these as the latest changes to my files.
3. A modified file it git means a tracked file whose content is changed. And that change in file hasn't yet been staged.
4. Working directory simply means your local git repo. Or, the directory in which `git init .` was run
5. The staging area if empty then it contains the last commit files.
6. Adding a file in git simply means putting it to staging area.
7. Local git repo can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, bitbucket, gitlabs, etc.
8. Remote repo mean a repo in some remote place (other than your local machine). Somewhere in cloud like GitHub. Then you link it with your local repo to contain the same things.
9. Repo = Repository.
